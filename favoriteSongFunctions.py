"""
Part of what makes this song my favorite, is that it is played in the Key of A-Minor. 
The reason that is important, is because the final boss that you fight, while this song is being played has the name 'Gwyn', which means white in Welsh
The name has a deeper meaning because A-Minor only has white keys, and so it matches with the name of the King, and 'Greatest of the Gods' in the game
